# Azure Challenge - App Modernization with Azure Functions

## Challenge 2: Stateful in a Serverless World

Great, you're now ready to write the business logic for Contoso's e-commerce app.

Considering the key aspect of keeping the costs down, you realize that many of the domains are in nature stateful. Specifically, they need to persist data which is accessible at any time.
One undeniable option would be to rely on data services, but that would also require these services to handled load, be scalable, be further secured, enforce authentication and authorization of sorts... Moreover, it would not keep the cost down.

After a thorough analysis of the current traffic and storage of shopping cart, product catalog and order data, you agree with the customer on using Durable Entities for leveraging these functionalities.
By the end of the challenge you should:

- Store the data for your product catalog, as well as the inventory of each product in a singleton Durable Entity
- Persist the shopping cart data of each customer in a Durable Entity, contextually designed to maintain an instance of the entity for each customer. It's worth pointing out that a customer can only have a single shopping cart at a time.
- Store all orders in a Durable Entity, also contextually designed to maintain an instance of the entity for each customer. Thus, an order entity instance would maintain all the customer's orders

All these stateful stores should be accessible via the REST APIs previously authored.
